# CloudStack Integration Pack

Apache CloudStack is open source software designed to deploy and manage large
networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly scalable
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform. CloudStack is used
by a number of service providers to offer public cloud services, and by many
companies to provide an on-premises (private) cloud offering, or as part of a
hybrid cloud solution.

CloudStack is a turnkey solution that includes the entire "stack" of features
most organizations want with an IaaS cloud: compute orchestration,
Network-as-a-Service, user and account management, a full and open native API,
resource accounting, and a first-class User Interface (UI).

CloudStack currently supports the most popular hypervisors:
VMware vSphere, KVM, XenServer, XenProject and Hyper-V as well as
OVM and LXC containers.

Users can manage their cloud with an easy to use Web interface, command line
tools, and/or a full-featured query based API.
